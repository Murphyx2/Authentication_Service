# Authentication Service

This is a microservice built with Django and PostgreSQL, providing JWT-based authentication for a personal finance project. It supports user registration, login, token refresh, and logout functionalities, leveraging Djangoâ€™s default User model with group-based authorization (e.g., "Admins", "Users"). The service is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and development.

## Features
- User Registration: Create new users with username, email, and password.

- Login: Authenticate users and issue JWT access and refresh tokens.

- Token Refresh: Generate new access tokens using refresh tokens.

- Logout: Blacklist refresh tokens (and optionally access tokens) to invalidate sessions.

- Group-Based Authorization: Assign users to groups (e.g., "Admins", "Users") included in JWT payloads.

- Dockerized: Runs with Docker Compose for consistent development and deployment.
